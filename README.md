# String Matching

This project display three algorithms with different data structures to find a specific pattern of string in big data by using some libraries that provide by python.

### Programming Language

python

### IDE to Start the Project

Spyder IDE
Download Link:

https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/latest/download/Spyder_64bit_full.exe

### How to open the project

Open the folder (String \_Matching )
The folder contains three folders each folder includes three code file for each data structure
and CSV data file.
We read "pcr_data.csv" data file by using pandas library and store our data in data frame which is a two-dimensional data structure in Python's Pandas library that represents a table of data with rows and columns.

### naïve algorithm

We implemented this algorithm by one function for each data structure ,the function takes two arguments: text string and pattern string.

### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)

We implemented this algorithm by two functions , the first one "KMPSearch" takes two arguments: pattern and text, the second one "computeLPSArray" takes three arguments : pattern, length of pattern and LPS List

### Edit Distance

We implemented this algorithm by one function for each data structure, the function takes two arguments: text string and pattern string.

## Libraries

- Pandas
- Time
- Queue

## The device

the device Asus ZenBook 14
Windows 11 Ryzen 5800H-7 Processor 16 GB RAM
512 GB SSD

We read 1740 rows of data, which are divided into 11 columns.
due to half of the hard drive's capacity being utilized, we did not experience any capacity-related issues, and delays were avoided.For the CPU, it has 6 cores, making it quick to execute simultaneous computations.
